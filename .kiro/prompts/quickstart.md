# Kiro CLI Quick Start Wizard

## Welcome
🚀 Welcome to the Kiro CLI Quick Start Wizard! This will help you set up your development environment with Kiro CLI by walking you through completing your project's steering documents and understanding all available features.

## Overview
This wizard will help you:
1. **Complete your steering documents** - Fill out the skeleton templates with your project details
2. **Understand your development workflow** - Learn about the available prompts and commands
3. **Explore advanced features** - Discover MCP servers, custom agents, hooks, and more

## Step 1: Complete Steering Documents

You already have skeleton steering documents in `.kiro/steering/`. Let's fill them out with your project details.

### Gather Project Information
**Note**: The more detailed you can be, the better! Specific information about what you're building, who it's for, and the components you want helps create better context for your coding assistant and future development work. But don't worry - you can always keep it brief if you prefer.

Ask the user these essential questions:

**Core Questions (Required):**
1. **Project Name**: "What's your project name?"
2. **Project Description**: "What does your project do? (1-2 sentences, or more detail if you'd like)"
3. **Target Users**: "Who will use this? (e.g., developers, end users, businesses - feel free to be specific about their needs)"
4. **Main Technology**: "What's your primary technology? (e.g., Python, JavaScript, React, etc.)"

**Optional Details:**
5. **Architecture** (if they want to specify): "Any specific architecture or patterns you're using? (optional - I can suggest based on your tech stack)"
6. **Special Requirements** (if any): "Any specific requirements for testing, deployment, or performance? (optional)"

### Update Steering Documents
After collecting responses, update the existing steering documents with intelligent defaults:

#### Update `.kiro/steering/product.md`:
Fill out based on user responses and intelligent assumptions:

```markdown

## Step 2: Development Workflow Overview

Now that your steering documents are complete, let's review your development workflow. You have access to these powerful prompts:

### Core Development Loop
- **`@prime`** - Load project context and understand your codebase
- **`@plan-feature`** - Create comprehensive implementation plans for new features
- **`@execute`** - Execute development plans with systematic task management
- **`@create-prd`** - Generate Product Requirements Documents

### Quality Assurance & Validation
- **`@code-review`** - Perform technical code reviews for quality and bugs
- **`@code-review-fix`** - Fix issues found in code reviews
- **`@execution-report`** - Generate implementation reports for completed work
- **`@system-review`** - Analyze implementation vs plan for process improvements

### GitHub Issue Management
- **`@rca`** - Perform root cause analysis for GitHub issues
- **`@implement-fix`** - Implement fixes based on RCA documents

### Typical Workflow
1. **Start with `@prime`** to understand your project context
2. **Use `@plan-feature`** to plan new features or changes
3. **Execute with `@execute`** to implement the plan systematically
4. **Review with `@code-review`** to ensure quality
5. **Generate reports** with `@execution-report` for documentation

## Step 3: Advanced Kiro Features

Beyond the core prompts, Kiro CLI offers powerful advanced features to enhance your development workflow:

### 🔧 MCP Servers (Model Context Protocol)
Connect external tools and APIs to extend Kiro's capabilities (AWS docs, git operations, database management, custom integrations).

### 🤖 Custom Agents
Create specialized AI assistants for specific workflows (backend specialist, frontend expert, DevOps agent, security reviewer, API designer).

### ⚡ Hooks (Automation)
Automate workflows and processes at specific lifecycle points (pre-commit hooks, post-deployment hooks, agent spawn hooks, tool execution hooks).

### 📚 Context Management
Optimize how Kiro understands your project (agent resources, session context, knowledge bases, context optimization).

### 🧠 Knowledge Management (Experimental)
Advanced knowledge base features (semantic search, code indexing, documentation integration, pattern learning).

### 🔄 Tangent Mode (Experimental)
Explore side topics without disrupting main conversation (side explorations, what-if scenarios, learning mode, context switching).

### 📋 TODO Lists & Checkpointing (Experimental)
Advanced task and progress management (persistent TODO lists, progress checkpoints, task dependencies, progress visualization).

### 🔀 Subagents
Delegate complex tasks to specialized subagents (parallel processing, specialized expertise, independent context, task delegation).

**Would you like help with any of these advanced features?** For example, I can help you set up MCP servers, create custom agents for specialized workflows, configure automation hooks, or enable experimental features like knowledge management and tangent mode.

## Step 4: Next Steps and Recommendations

Based on your project setup, here are recommended next steps:

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test your setup**: Try `@prime` to load your project context
2. **Plan your first feature**: Use `@plan-feature` for your next development task
3. **Set up your preferred model**: Use `/model` to choose the best AI model for your needs

### Recommended Configurations
Based on your project type and tech stack, suggest specific configurations:
- **For web applications**: Recommend frontend/backend agents and deployment hooks
- **For APIs**: Suggest API design agents and testing automation
- **For data projects**: Recommend database MCP servers and analysis agents
- **For open source**: Suggest GitHub integration and community management tools
