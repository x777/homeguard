## What is a credit?[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/related-questions/#what-is-a-credit)
A credit is a unit of work in response to user prompts. Simple prompts can consume less than 1 credit. More complex prompts, such as executing a spec task, typically cost more than 1 credit. Additionally, different models consume credits at different rates, with a prompt executed via Sonnet 4 costing more credits than executing it with Auto. For example, a given task that consumes X credits to execute in Auto, will cost you 1.3X credits to execute via Sonnet 4. Credits are metered to the second decimal point, so the least number of credits a task can consume is 0.01 credits.
## What paid plan should I choose if I'm not sure about my future usage?[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/related-questions/#what-paid-plan-should-i-choose-if-im-not-sure-about-my-future-usage)
Many customers are still exploring agentic development, and we expect that learning curve to continue beyond the first month. We don’t want you to have to predict your future usage or “time” upgrades to get a fair deal—we want you focused on building. A good path is to start on Pro and, if needed, enable overage so you can continue working without friction. If you later decide you need more, upgrade when you’re ready. In your first paid month we’ll discount for what you already paid and charge a single prorated amount for the higher plan back to the day you first became paid, so you won’t pay more than if you had upgraded earlier. For example, in a 30-day month if you start Pro on day 15 ($10 for the rest of the month) and later switch to Pro+ the same month, we discount for the $10 and charge $20—net $10—so you finish the month on Pro+ with one prorated allowance. From Month 2 onward, upgrades charge the full price difference and we re-rate the whole month under the higher plan’s limits, which also prevents overpaying.
## What paid plan should I choose once my Kiro usage is stable?[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/related-questions/#what-paid-plan-should-i-choose-once-my-kiro-usage-is-stable)
Our intent with Kiro’s pricing is to let most developers work comfortably without micromanaging usage or worrying about surprises. Once your usage settles into a pattern, choose the smallest subscription plan that reliably covers a typical month, with a little headroom. That reflects our goal of making your default experience predictable: if you prefer a fixed bill, leave overage off and your usage will pause at the cap; if you prefer continuity during occasional spikes, keep overage on. If those spikes become frequent, or your month-end overage spend starts to approach the price difference to the next tier, moving up will usually lower your total cost while keeping things simple.
## What happens when I reach the monthly limit of my plan?[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/related-questions/#what-happens-when-i-reach-the-monthly-limit-of-my-plan)
If you hit the limit, requests pause until your limits reset at the start of the next month.
The **Kiro Free** tier has fixed monthly limits and does not allow overage. If you hit a Free limit, you can upgrade to a paid plan for immediate additional capacity.
On paid plans, you can enable overage to continue working uninterrupted beyond your included limits. You can also upgrade to a higher plan at any time, and the higher usage limits immediately apply.
## I'm near month-end. Should I upgrade now or rely on overage?[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/related-questions/#im-near-month-end-should-i-upgrade-now-or-rely-on-overage)
If you're on a paid plan and only have a few days left, turning on overage is often the simplest way to finish the month unless your month-to-date overage cost is approaching the price difference to the next tier. When that "breakeven" point is reached, upgrading will usually lower your total bill and raise your limits immediately. In your first paid month, if you do upgrade late, we apply a discount for what you've already paid and charge a single prorated amount for the higher plan back to the day you first became paid, so you don't overpay for waiting a bit. From Month 2 onward, mid-month upgrades charge the full price difference and we re-rate the whole month under the higher plan.
## What happens to my bonus credits if I upgrade early?[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/related-questions/#what-happens-to-my-bonus-credits-if-i-upgrade-early)
If you are within the 30 day trial period for the bonus credits, those credits will carry over for the remainder of the 30 day trial period, independent of the plan you upgrade to.
## How does proration work during the initial month that I upgrade from the free trial or Kiro free tier to paying?[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/related-questions/#how-does-proration-work-during-the-initial-month-that-i-upgrade-from-the-free-trial-or-kiro-free-tier-to-paying)
During the month that you first upgrade to a paid plan, the plan charges are pro-rated by days remaining in the month. For example, in a 30-day month, if you upgrade to Pro ($20) with 10 days left (i.e., on day 21), you pay $6.67 (10/30 of $20) and receive access to Pro credit limits immediately. Informally, because you’re on Pro for one-third of the month, you pay one-third of the price, but get the full monthly quota of your new plan immediately.
If you later upgrade to Pro+ ($40) in that same first paid month, we discount the $6.67 you already paid for Pro and charge $13.33 (10⁄30 of $40), so your net extra payment is $6.66 at the time of upgrade. On your invoice, this appears as a discount line for the earlier Pro charge and a prorated charge line for Pro+.
## How does proration work after the first upgrade?[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/related-questions/#how-does-proration-work-after-the-first-upgrade)
Prorated pay only applies to the first upgrade. After the first upgrade, any future upgrade, at any day of the month, will be charged in full and users will receive full plan limits.
## What happens to my existing overage if I upgrade during the middle of the month?[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/related-questions/#what-happens-to-my-existing-overage-if-i-upgrade-during-the-middle-of-the-month)
Our intent is that you shouldn’t have to “time” an upgrade or pay twice for the same usage. When you upgrade to a higher subscription plan mid-month, we re-evaluate your month-to-date usage under the higher plan, so you get the benefit of its larger limits.
## When does Kiro bill me?[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/related-questions/#when-does-kiro-bill-me)
Kiro bills on a calendar month. Your billing month starts at 12:00 a.m. (UTC) on the first day of the month and ends at 11:59 p.m. (UTC) on the last day. The exact timing of your monthly charge will depend on your local timezone. If you upgrade mid-month, we will bill you immediately for the cost of the new plan discounted by the cost of the prior plan. Overage is included as separate line items on your month’s bill.
## Why might a single action span more than one credit?[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/related-questions/#why-might-a-single-action-span-more-than-one-credit)
Some actions require much more context or generate more output than average, such as working across a large codebase or executing a highly complex build. When that happens, the total token usage can exceed the limit for a single request, and Kiro will count it as more than one credit. You’ll see the count right after the interaction finishes.
## How does Kiro help optimize my costs?[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/related-questions/#how-does-kiro-help-optimize-my-costs)
Kiro is engineered to minimize redundant LLM work. We reuse context where possible and apply provider‑level efficiencies, such as token‑efficient tool use and prompt caching when available, to cut underlying token spend without adding friction to your workflow. You pay by request, not by token, and we pass efficiency gains through Kiro's pricing plan design rather than asking you to micromanage prompts.
