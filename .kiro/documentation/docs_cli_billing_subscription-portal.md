# Managing Your Kiro Subscription
Your Kiro subscription gives you access to powerful AI-powered development tools. You can manage your subscription, view usage, and update billing information through the subscription portal.
## Accessing the subscription portal[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/subscription-portal/#accessing-the-subscription-portal)
Follow [this link](https://app.kiro.dev/account/usage) to the portal.
You can also use the `/usage` command to remind you of the URL.
## What you can do in the portal[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/subscription-portal/#what-you-can-do-in-the-portal)
Once you're in the subscription portal, you can:
  * **View current plan** and usage statistics

  * **Update payment methods** and billing information
  * **Download invoices** and billing history
  * **Manage team members** (for team plans)
