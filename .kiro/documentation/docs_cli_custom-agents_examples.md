## Tips for Creating Effective Custom Agents[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/custom-agents/examples/#tips-for-creating-effective-custom-agents)
  * **Start simple** - Begin with basic tool configurations and add complexity as needed
  * **Use descriptive names** - Choose custom agent names that clearly indicate their purpose
  * **Include relevant context** - Add project documentation and configuration files to resources
  * **Pre-approve safe tools** - Include frequently used, low-risk tools in allowedTools
  * **Use hooks for dynamic context** - Include current system state through command hooks
  * **Limit tool scope** - Use toolsSettings to restrict tool access to relevant paths and services
  * **Test thoroughly** - Verify that your custom agent configuration works as expected
  * **Document your custom agents** - Use clear descriptions to help team members understand custom agent purposes


## Remote MCP Server Integration[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/custom-agents/examples/#remote-mcp-server-integration)
This example shows an agent configured to use a remote MCP server:
json
```

{
  "name": "domain-finder",
  "description": "Agent with access to domain search capabilities",
  "prompt": "You help users find and research domain names using the find-a-domain service.",
  "mcpServers": {
    "find-a-domain": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.findadomain.dev/mcp"
    }
  },
  "tools": ["@find-a-domain"],
  "allowedTools": ["@find-a-domain"]
}


```

This agent provides access to domain search tools through a remote MCP server. If the server requires OAuth authentication, use the `/mcp` command to authenticate when prompted.
