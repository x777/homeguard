# Supported regions
There are two AWS Regions relevant to Kiro administrators:
  * The Region where your IAM Identity Center instance is enabled. This is where user identities are managed, and where subscriptions are stored.
  * The Region where your Kiro profile is created. This is where [data is stored](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/privacy-and-security/data-protection#data-storage) and [inference is done](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/privacy-and-security/data-protection#cross-region-processing), and might be different from your IAM Identity Center instance's Region.
