# Authentication methods
Kiro supports the following authentication providers:
  * GitHub: Seamless integration with your GitHub account
  * Google: Sign in with your Google credentials
  * AWS Builder ID: Quick setup for individual developers
  * AWS IAM Identity Center: Enterprise-grade authentication


**Info**
Users that have a paid Kiro subscription and access it through a social login provider (like GitHub or Google) or through AWS Builder ID are considered _individual subscribers_. We may use certain content from Kiro Free Tier and Kiro individual subscribers for service improvement. For more information on service improvement and how to opt out, see [Service improvement](https://kiro.dev/docs/privacy-and-security/data-protection/#service-improvement).
