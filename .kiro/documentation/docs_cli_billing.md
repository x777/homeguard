# Billing for individuals
Kiro offers four distinct service tiers designed to meet different development needs: **Kiro Free** , **Kiro Pro** , **Kiro Pro+** , and **Kiro Power**. Each tier provides progressively more capabilities.
New Kiro users are automatically enrolled in a 30 day free trial. The free trial is a temporary enhancement to the perpetual **Kiro Free** tier that allows you to test Pro features by providing 500 credits to use over a 30 day trial period. After your trial, you'll need to choose one of Kiro's paid tiers or switch to the perpetual **Kiro Free** tier, and any unused credits will expire.
**Info**
If you upgrade tiers during the 30 day trial, you'll keep the 500 credits, but any unused trial credits will expire after the 30 days are complete. For example, if you upgrade to the Pro tier within 30 days, you'll have 1,500 credits (1,000 Pro + 500 Trial). After 30 days, unused trial credit expires, leaving you with the Pro tier credits.
Credits are consumed fractionally based on each request. Simple edits and shorter prompts will use fewer credits than complex, lengthy tasks. This means that fractional credits allow you to get more value from your credit allocation.

## Billing practices[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/#billing-practices)
Note the following billing practices when you subscribe, downgrade, unsubscribe, and incur overages:
  * If you are on the **Kiro Free** tier, have never upgraded before, and **upgrade** to the Pro, Pro+, or Power tier mid-month, you are charged a prorated fee, but immediately get access to your new plan's full credit limits. For example, if you subscribe to Pro on April 15th, you'll be charged half the subscription fee and be able to use all of the credits for that tier. Additionally, if you decide to **upgrade** again on April 20th to Pro+, you'll get backdated prorated fees and access to the full credit limits of that tier, as if you directly upgraded to Pro+ on April 15th. After that, you'll be charged the full amount.
  * If you are on any paid tier, such as the Pro, Pro+, or Power tier, and **upgrade** to another paid tier, you are charged a retroactive fee for the entire month based on the price difference. For example, if you upgrade from a Pro to a Pro+ tier, you'll be charged the difference in the subscription fee and at the end of the month, Kiro will recalculate the entire month's usage under the new tier's credits. In this case, if you used 1,010 credits, that would be 10 credits over the Pro cap, however since you upgrade to the Pro+ tier, you avoided paying an overage fee.
**Info**
If you're on a paid tier, switch to the **Kiro Free** tier, and then switch back to a paid tier, the payment behavior will be the same as above. Note that downgrades take effect in the following month and upgrades are effective immediately.
  * If you **downgrade** from Pro+ to Pro tier mid-month, you are charged the full fee for that month. For example, if you downgrade on June 2nd, you'll be charged the full Pro+ subscription fee for the month of June. From July onward, you will be charged the Pro fee.
  * If you **incur overages** , you are charged the total overage fees for the month at the end of the current billing cycle.
  * For all tiers, your **usage cap** renews at the beginning of the next billing cycle.
