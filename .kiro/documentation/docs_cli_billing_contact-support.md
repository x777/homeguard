# Contacting billing support
If you need assistance with billing questions, payment issues, subscription changes, or other account-related concerns, you can contact our billing support team directly.
## When to contact billing support[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/contact-support/#when-to-contact-billing-support)
Contact billing support for help with:
  * **Payment issues** - Failed payments, updating payment methods, or billing errors
  * **Subscription questions** - Plan changes, upgrade/downgrade assistance, or billing cycle inquiries
  * **Account access** - Issues accessing your account or billing dashboard
  * **Refund requests** - Questions about refunds or billing disputes
  * **Usage clarification** - Understanding your usage charges or tier limits
  * **Invoice questions** - Requesting copies of invoices or clarifying charges


## How to contact support[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/contact-support/#how-to-contact-support)
You can contact billing support in two ways:
### Option 1: Command line[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/contact-support/#option-1-command-line)
Use the Kiro CLI issue reporting command:
bash
```

kiro-cli issue


```

### Option 2: From within chat[](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/billing/contact-support/#option-2-from-within-chat)
If you're already in a Kiro CLI chat session, you can use the built-in issue reporting tool to create a GitHub issue with pre-filled context. Just tell Kiro in natural language about the issue that you want to report, and it will help you create the issue on GitHub.
Both methods will help you create a support request that gets routed to our billing team.

  * **Account details** - Your Kiro account email and subscription information
  * **Context** - Any relevant error messages or circumstances
