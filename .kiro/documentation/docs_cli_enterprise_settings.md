# Settings
An administrator can control the following settings in a [Kiro profile](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/enterprise/concepts/#kiro-profile).
Setting | Description  
---|---  
**Encryption key** | By default, Kiro uses an AWS managed key to encrypt your data at rest. For some features, instead of using an AWS managed key, you can use your own key. This is known as a _customer-managed key_. To specify a customer-managed key, enable **Encryption key** and use the available UI to specify a new or existing key. For details about which features' data can be encrypted with a customer managed key, see [Encryption at rest](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/privacy-and-security/data-protection#encryption-at-rest).  
**Include suggestions with code references** | Kiro learns, in part, from open-source projects. Sometimes, Kiro suggests code that is similar to publicly available code. When you enable **Include suggestions with code references** , Kiro will include information about the source used to generate a suggestion.  
**Kiro usage dashboard** | Enable **Kiro usage dashboard** to display a dashboard on the Kiro console's main page. For more information about the dashboard, see [Viewing Kiro usage on the dashboard](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/enterprise/monitor-and-track/dashboard).  
**Kiro user activity report** | Enable **Kiro user activity report** to allow Kiro to collect user activity telemetry of individual Kiro subscribers in your organization and present that information in a report. For more information, see [Viewing per-user activity](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/enterprise/monitor-and-track/user-activity).  
**Prompt logging** | Enable **Logging** to allow Kiro to record all inline suggestions and chat conversations that users have in the Kiro IDE. For more information, see [Logging users' prompts](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/enterprise/monitor-and-track/prompt-logging).  
**Member account subscriptions** | If you are a management account administrator within an organization managed by [AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html), you can configure Kiro to display Kiro subscriptions from both _management_ and _member_ accounts in a single, unified list on the **Subscriptions** page of the Amazon Q console (_not_ the Kiro console) while signed in to your management account. This organization-wide visibility eliminates the need to sign in to multiple accounts to track your subscriptions. To have all Kiro subscriptions be displayed in the Amazon Q console, enable the **Member account subscriptions** setting. This setting is only visible when signed in to the AWS console as a management account administrator.  
**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** | Enable the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** setting to allow Kiro subscribers to use MCP servers.  
**Overages** | Enable **Overages** to allow Kiro subscribers to continue working when they exceed their plan limits. For more information see [Enabling overages for Kiro users](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/enterprise/subscription-management#enabling-overages-for-kiro-users).
